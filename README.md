# Directory Encoding and Decoding Scripts

This repository contains two Bash scripts, `direncode` and `dirdecode`, which can be used to encode and decode directory structures and their contents into base64 strings.

## direncode

The `direncode` script encodes a directory and its contents into a base64 string. The encoded output can be saved to a file or used in various other ways.

Use the `--help` flag for more information.

## dirdecode

The `dirdecode` script decodes a base64 string into a directory and its contents. The base64 input can be read from a file or pasted directly into the terminal.

Use the `--help` flag for more information.

These scripts and even the readme were originally generated by ChatGPT.
